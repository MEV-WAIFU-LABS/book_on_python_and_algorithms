## stacks 


<br>

* stacks are **last in, first out** structures (LIFO), where the newest element is first one to be removed from the structure.
* stacks are useful in certain recursive algorithms, where you can push temp data as you recurse, and remove them from the (memory or data structure) stack as you backtrace.
